> ## About me
> I am 39 years old. I work as a backend developer in Astana, Kazakhstan.  
> I have extensive experience working with PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases, interacting with them using Java, SQL, and Delphi languages, as well as Spring and JavaEE frameworks. Currently, I have a large number of completed and maintained projects, both small and large, in the field of education.  
> Throughout my career, I strive to continually develop myself, keep up with new trends, and follow the development of existing technologies. In my work, I find that my knowledge of implementing the frontend part of a project is lacking for complete project coverage.  
> To address this, I have previously studied JavaScript and frameworks like Angular and Vue. I joined this course to gain knowledge in web design.
